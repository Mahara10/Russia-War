# Russia-War
This project serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding the dynamics of Russian equipment losses. By leveraging key metrics and interactive dashboards, stakeholders can gain actionable insights into military operations, identify critical trends, and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies over time.


Key Metrics
The following key metrics were used in the analysis:

Daily Loss Count:

Sum of losses for each equipment type on a given day.
Cumulative Losses:

Running total of losses for each equipment type over time.
Useful for identifying overall trends and spikes in losses.
Proportional Losses:

Share of total losses attributed to each equipment type.
Calculated as:
Proportion
=
Losses for a specific equipment type
Total losses across all equipment types
Proportion= 
Total losses across all equipment types
Losses for a specific equipment type
​
 
Greatest Losses Direction Frequency:

Number of times a specific region or direction had the highest losses.
Correlation Between Equipment Types:

Statistical relationship between the losses of various equipment types (e.g., tanks vs. APCs).
Helps in understanding if specific losses tend to occur together.
Anomalies in Loss Trends:

Identification of unusual spikes in daily losses using anomaly detection techniques.
Highlights significant military events or changes in strategy.
Visualization Summary
Average Daily Losses by Equipment Type:

Clustered column chart to show which equipment types face the highest average daily losses.
Cumulative Losses Over Time:

Line charts showing how losses for different equipment types grow over time.
Proportional Losses:

Pie chart showing the contribution of each equipment type to total losses.
Regional Loss Hotspots:

Bar chart showing the frequency of greatest losses by region (greatest losses direction).
Correlation Heatmap:

Python visual to identify relationships between losses of different equipment types.
Anomaly Detection:

Line charts with anomaly detection to pinpoint significant spikes in losses.
Key Insights
Trends Over Time:

Identified periods of significant spikes in losses, likely corresponding to major military engagements.
Equipment Loss Contributions:

Tanks and APCs often account for the highest proportions of total losses, reflecting their heavy use in ground operations.
Regional Analysis:

Certain directions/regions are consistently associated with higher losses, indicating concentrated military activity.
Correlations:

Strong correlations between losses of tanks and APCs suggest combined-arms operations often lead to simultaneous losses of multiple equipment types.
Logistical Impact:

High cumulative losses in vehicles and fuel tanks indicate potential challenges in maintaining supply lines and mobility.
Anomalies:

Detected significant anomalies in losses for specific equipment types, which can provide insights into unexpected events or shifts in tactics.
